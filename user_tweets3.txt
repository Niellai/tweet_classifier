@SMRT_Singapore you are rebranding it into a consumers-stressing-and-not-appreciating-repairmen issue which is not innovuous
@SMRT_Singapore the issue was never the workers doing the daily work. It is top brass and senior mgmt who call the shots
@SMRT_Singapore which is reliability that is falling even further due to years of maintenance under investment and neglect
@SMRT_Singapore cool, I appreciate the hard work of the repairman in the wee hours, but please don't use this to detract from the real issue
@SMRT_Singapore He's not lost
@SMRT_Singapore there seems to be a lost child on NEL, at Potong Pasir now. Towards Punggol.
