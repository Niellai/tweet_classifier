@SMRT_Singapore Shouldnt it be due to our "oversight" or "carelessness" or "lack of proper management"...
@SMRT_Singapore Why everything classified under "track fault"
@smrt_singapore wouldn't use or recommend your tourist pass. No one at Orchard to refund our deposit. Very annoying on our last night
@SMRT_Singapore @STcom No fare increase till full restoration in the next 2 years or so...no one should pay for bad service and management

@SMRT_Singapore I thought EW line couldn't get slower, already added 30 minutes to my travel time but today you manage to beat the record
@SMRT_Singapore if adding 4 stations to the East West line meant adding 40mins to my journey, I rather you donâ€™t add the 4 stops.
@SMRT_Singapore Should come and check at Jurong East mrt. Lots of ppl waiting to board when it's only 8am. The service is getting worse.

@SMRT_Singapore you are rebranding it into a consumers-stressing-and-not-appreciating-repairmen issue which is not innovuous
@SMRT_Singapore the issue was never the workers doing the daily work. It is top brass and senior mgmt who call the shots
@SMRT_Singapore which is reliability that is falling even further due to years of maintenance under investment and neglect
@SMRT_Singapore cool, I appreciate the hard work of the repairman in the wee hours, but please don't use this to detract from the real issue
@SMRT_Singapore He's not lost
@SMRT_Singapore there seems to be a lost child on NEL, at Potong Pasir now. Towards Punggol.
