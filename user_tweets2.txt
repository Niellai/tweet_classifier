@SMRT_Singapore @TODAYonline you make me doubt whether smartnation is a bigger white elephant or worse
@SMRT_Singapore Advising public to take NS line via woodlands to Cbd or EW line? abit confusing
@SMRT_Singapore 15 minutes??? From CCK to JE, it's already 29 minutes, and still no sign of the platform.
@SMRT_Singapore Not due to new signaling project = does it mean it's a perpetual issue? How about delays for trains‚Ä¶ https://t.co/KCZkbzDRTz
@SMRT_Singapore How come no announcement for the delay at east west line??
@SMRT_Singapore Your train service is going backward so sad
@SMRT_Singapore What type of checking your great engineers do every morning? Taking breakfast on the track causing it to be faulty?üò°
@SMRT_Singapore Part of daily life and turning into a norm
@SMRT_Singapore So what you are telling us is that not only do you have incompetence in the signalling system but also in many areas. üòÇüòÇ
Due to congestion towards Jurong East,pax travelling towards CBD are advised to take train in the direction thru Woodlands towards MarinaSouthPier.

@SMRT_Singapore Think ur new signalling system is a failure. Why bother to test it everyday and spoil OUR DAY and cock up your system
@SMRT_Singapore Today i have a meeting at 8.30am! Why of all the days, you must breakdown today!
@SMRT_Singapore You are indirectly causing road congestion. Please get your shit together.
@SMRT_Singapore @SMRT_Singapore  do till liddat i rather u all dont do n close train systems
@SMRT_Singapore Why start a new signalling project that does not benefit the users but also bought more inconvenience to the user.
@SMRT_Singapore Hahaha. Once again shit service and a warning after the fact. All I need now is a time machine to heed it.
@SMRT_Singapore NSL fails again. How to keep office hours like this?
