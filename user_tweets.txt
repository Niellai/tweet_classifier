@SMRT_Singapore Why everything classified under "track fault"
@smrt_singapore wouldn't use or recommend your tourist pass. No one at Orchard to refund our deposit. Very annoying on our last night
@SMRT_Singapore @STcom No fare increase till full restoration in the next 2 years or so...no one should pay for bad service and management
Check our bus guides at https://t.co/BhsDU761R6 … … for details on bus services.
@SMRT_Singapore if i know u took every 3min to open the bloody door and close bloody door. I will go take bus.

@SMRT_Singapore I thought EW line couldn't get slower, already added 30 minutes to my travel time but today you manage to beat the record
@SMRT_Singapore if adding 4 stations to the East West line meant adding 40mins to my journey, I rather you don’t add the 4 stops.
@SMRT_Singapore Should come and check at Jurong East mrt. Lots of ppl waiting to board when it's only 8am. The service is getting worse.
@SMRT_Singapore there is no less crowded area on jurong east platform. 27/6/17

@SMRT_Singapore @TODAYonline you make me doubt whether smartnation is a bigger white elephant or worse
@SMRT_Singapore Advising public to take NS line via woodlands to Cbd or EW line? abit confusing
@SMRT_Singapore 15 minutes??? From CCK to JE, it's already 29 minutes, and still no sign of the platform.
@SMRT_Singapore Not due to new signaling project = does it mean it's a perpetual issue? How about delays for trains… https://t.co/KCZkbzDRTz
@SMRT_Singapore How come no announcement for the delay at east west line??
@SMRT_Singapore Your train service is going backward so sad
@SMRT_Singapore What type of checking your great engineers do every morning? Taking breakfast on the track causing it to be faulty?😡
@SMRT_Singapore Part of daily life and turning into a norm
@SMRT_Singapore So what you are telling us is that not only do you have incompetence in the signalling system but also in many areas. 😂😂
Due to congestion towards Jurong East,pax travelling towards CBD are advised to take train in the direction thru Woodlands towards MarinaSouthPier.
@SMRT_Singapore how can the train frequency on the EW line be more than 5 minutes during peak hour? What is wrong with you people.
@SMRT_Singapore Does telling us the delay this morning is not due to signalling issue makes you less guilty of the… https://t.co/Mzx4IhtB0F
@SMRT_Singapore This picture depicts your situation perfectly. You are sunset. Gone soon.
@SMRT_Singapore Think ur new signalling system is a failure. Why bother to test it everyday and spoil OUR DAY and cock up your system
@SMRT_Singapore Today i have a meeting at 8.30am! Why of all the days, you must breakdown today!
@SMRT_Singapore You are indirectly causing road congestion. Please get your shit together.
@SMRT_Singapore @SMRT_Singapore  do till liddat i rather u all dont do n close train systems
@SMRT_Singapore Why start a new signalling project that does not benefit the users but also bought more inconvenience to the user.
@SMRT_Singapore Hahaha. Once again shit service and a warning after the fact. All I need now is a time machine to heed it.
@SMRT_Singapore NSL fails again. How to keep office hours like this?
@SMRT_Singapore When will there be a day where there's no freaking delay? When will Singaporeans get back the SMRT from years ago?

@SMRT_Singapore Just admit that your system and the top management is not up to the required standard and capability
@SMRT_Singapore CAN SMRT STOP ALL YOUR FUCKING TESTING!!!!!!!!?
[NSL]: Due to a track fault, please add 15mins train travel time from #YewTee to #JurongEast. (Not linked to new signalling project).
@SMRT_Singapore It's not like we're hosting the SEA Games at Jurong East.
@SMRT_Singapore I don't understand how it's expected congestion when it's the usual crowd that you see every weekday.
@SMRT_Singapore WTF WTF Why every morning!!!!!!!!!
Due to expected congestion towards JurongEast from Woodlands,Pax travelling towards CBD are advised to take SB train towards MarinaSouthPier
@SMRT_Singapore Trains are going very slow and stopping every few meters. This is a delay for sure. So why no notification on the app?
@SMRT_Singapore Early morning must entertain your bullshit, piss off.
@SMRT_Singapore It has been making me late for work everytime
@SMRT_Singapore Rotten to the core
@SMRT_Singapore If i goto DB or confined because of this, will you  jokers sit in DB for me?

@SMRT_Singapore There's train delay at NS line, how about tweet this instead of some useless pic?
@SMRT_Singapore [NSL]: Our engineers are working hard to continue their checks and investigations. Our staff is ready to assist.
@SMRT_Singapore Your new train boards are useless and poorly designed. #bringthedotsback
